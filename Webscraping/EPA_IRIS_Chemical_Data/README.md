# EPA IRIS Assessments Web Scrape

A web scrape is performed in EPA_IRIS_Assessments_Web_Scrape.ipynb and the resulting data is then cleaned in EPA_IRIS_Assessments_Cleaning.ipynb.

Both Python scripts save the data as comma separated values (CSV) files and are also available.
The CSV labeled as "dirty" in the file name is the CSV that results from the raw web scrape with no data cleaning.
The CSV labeled as "clean" in the file name is the CSV that results from data cleaning of the raw web scrape CSV file.

A full report is provided as a PDF.
