The specific mechanisms of 1,3-butadiene-induced carcinogenesis are unknown however, the scientific evidence strongly suggests that the carcinogenic effects are mediated by genotoxic metabolites of 1,3-butadiene, i.e., the monoepoxide, the diepoxide, and the epoxydiol.

Chloroform is not likely to be carcinogenic to humans by any route of exposure under exposure conditions that do not cause cytotoxicity and cell regeneration. This weight-of-evidence conclusion is based on: 1) observations in animals exposed by both oral and inhalation pathways which indicate that sustained or repeated cytotoxicity with secondary regenerative hyperplasia precedes, and is probably required for, hepatic and renal neoplasia; 2) there are no epidemiological data specific to chloroform and, at most, equivocal epidemiological data related to drinking water exposures that cannot necessarily be negative, although there are some scattered positive results that generally have limitations such as excessively high dose or with confounding factors. Thus, the weigh-of-evidence of the genotoxicity data on chloroform supports a conclusion that chloroform is not strongly mutagenic, and the genotoxicity is not likely to be the predominant mode of action underlying the carcinogenic potential of chloroform. Although no cancer data exist for exposures via the dermal pathway, the weight-of-evidence conclusion is considered to be applicable to this pathway as well, because chloroform absorbed through the skin and into the blood is expected to be metabolized and to cause toxicity in much the same way as chloroform absorbed by other exposure routes.

Focal papillary hyperplasia and squamous cell papillomas in the forestomach as well as thyroid follicular cell adenomas and carcinomas were observed in male rats gavaged with mercuric chloride for 2 years. The relevance of the forestomach papillomas to assessment of cancer in humans is questionable because no evidence indicated that the papillomas progressed to malignancy. The relevance of the increase in thyroid tumors has also been questioned because these tumors are generally considered to be secondary to hyperplasia; this effect was not observed in the high-dose males. It should also be noted that the authors considered the doses used in the study to exceed the MTD for male rats. In the same study, evidence for increases in squamous cell papillomas in the forestomach of female rats was equivocal. In a second study, equivocal evidence for renal adenomas and adenocarcinomas was observed in male mice; there was a significant positive trend.

These mixtures contain overlapping groups of congeners that, together, span the range of congeners most often found in environmental mixtures. Earlier studies found high, statistically significant incidences of liver tumors in rats ingesting Aroclor 1260 or Clophen A 60 (Kimbrough et al., 1975 Norback and Weltman, 1985 Schaeffer et al., 1984). Mechanistic studies are beginning to identify several congeners that have dioxin-like activity and may promote tumors by different modes of action. PCBs are absorbed through ingestion, inhalation, and dermal exposure, after which they are transported similarly through the circulation. This provides a reasonable basis for expecting similar internal effects from different routes of environmental exposure. Information on relative absorption rates suggests that differences in toxicity across exposure routes are small.
