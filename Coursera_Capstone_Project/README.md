# IBM Applied Data Science Capstone Project

Main notebook is Coursera_Applied_DS_Capstone.ipynb.

To run notebook you will need your own Foursquare credentials.

The folium maps generated in the notebook tend to use up a good bit of memory pretty quickly so you may wish to clear outputs when moving on to other cells to avoid Jupyter from crashing.

Furthermore, you will need the GeoJSON files for the necessary states illustrated in the project notebook which can be found here: https://github.com/OpenDataDE/State-zip-code-GeoJSON.

The report file for the project is Coursera_Cap_Report.ipynb.
