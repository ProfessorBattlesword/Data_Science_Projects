    "A preliminary investigation shows that Denver, Colorado; Seattle, Washington; Charlotte, North Carolina; Austin, Texas; and Fort Worth, Texas are promising candidates for Company X to expand its services to. Each city has similar top-rated venues and population demographics. Furthermore, investigation of each of these five cities shows the postal code boundaries of where the most popular venues reside suggesting a generalized location within each of the five cities to further consider where Company X should expand. In particular, Austin and Fort Worth, Texas appear to be particularly good candidates for possible future expansion within the whole state while allowing for potential expansion outside of the state in various regions across the United States."

    "Company X wishes to branch out their business chain by opening new locations in ideal US cities. To identify which US cities might be ideal candidates as well as ideal locations within those cities we explore relationships between the most populous US cities and the types of venues that correspond to each. We will then perform agglomerative hierarchical clustering to see which of the most populous US cities might be worthy of looking into further. The hierarchical clustering will be based on population, population change (percent increase/decrease), and the 100 top-rated types of venues that exist within them (near the city centers). Once the hierarchical clustering is completed, a more in-depth study can then be performed by Company X. Therefore, this work is a preliminary investigation step for Company X's expansion prospects.\n",

    "Firstly, we note that the goal of this study is to perform a preliminary investigation of what cities *might* be good candidats for Company X to expand their chain. Our approach is to (1) use hierarchical clusering to cluster some of the most populous cities based on total population, high population growth, and popular venues in close proximity to each city's geographical center; (2) select a small group of similar cities from the hierarchical clustering for further investigation as to where expansion might be recommended. In order to perform the hierarchical clustering, we need to find appropriate data sources for the most populous US cities as well as the top-rated venues within the city centers. A quick google search and webscrape is performed with the following wikipedia page: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_United_States_cities_by_population. We obtain the venue data by leveraging the Foursquare API. Once the data from both sources is collected and cleaned, we perform agglomerative hierarchical clustering. Once the clustering is performed, we make a small selection of similar cities and investigate total top-rated venues within postal code boundaries. The hypothesis here is that if the expansion of Company X's chain in one city proves to be successful, then expansion into other like cities should have a high probability of being met with similar success."

The table is clearly not easily readable or convenient for feature use in its raw form. To clean the dataframe we drop the \"2020rank\" column as this is an unnecessary feature since we can just use the index of the dataframe to determine rank (if desired at a later stage). The column names are changed for convenience of referencing. Leftover characters that show as superscripts in the html page from the raw scrape are present in the \"City\" column and therefore those need tidying up. The \"Change\" column should be expressed without the \"+\" and \"%\" characters and converted to type float. The location column is quite messy and decimal format is adopted for the latitude and longitude values.\n",

    "Additionally, we need to be aware that the effort exerted thus far is a preliminary investigation. There are likely several other factors that should be considered before actual expansion occurs. Leveraging the Foursquare API with more than 100 top-rated venues would likely be beneficial, and venue type is not necessarily well organized in the sense that Foursquare can return venues with similar, yet disticnt string names (e.g. one venue might be listed with the category \"American\", and another venue might be listed with the category \"American Restaurant,\" which would essentially be part of the same venue type). For the sake of time, these issues were not addressed in this work, but should be addressed in future work.\n",

    "Since both Austin and Fort Worth have strong similarity based on the dendrogram (see Figure 6), and since the state of Texas contains several high-influx cities (see Figure 3), a logical first choice for expansion amonst all five cities would be either Austin, Texas; Fort Worth, Texas; or both. This would create several future expansion opportunities since Texas shows a growing population, and a presence in the state would allow for inexpensive advertising via word-of-mouth for those who live within city limits and for travelers within the state. Furthermore, the other three cities outside of Texas, based again on the similarity from the dendrogram (see Figure 6), would allow for expansion into several scattered positions throughout the US and thus establish locations that have high potential for success in multiple regions of the US: northwestern, midwestern, southwestern, and eastern United States."
